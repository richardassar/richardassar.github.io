							<p>I worked on the MusicFlow web application, a web based audio editing suite for dynamic compositions. For this project we used CoffeScript, Backbone.js, Ruby on Rails, Capybara, Casper.js and many other technologies. The role saw me as part of a two-man team, working with <a href="http://www.ronenbarzel.org/">Ronen Barzel</a>. Working in such a small team meant a lot of room for autonomy and creativity. In addition to the composer tools I created a user-facing HTML5 video editor for arranging and previewing dynamic scores with video.</p>

							<h4>Programming</h4>

							<p>I began when I was very young, on a BBC Micro at around 5 years old. Programming has always been a passion of mine, it filled my childhood with immense joy, creativity and excitement at the seemingly endless possibilities. There has always been a desire to create virtual worlds, to create experiences that would touch the lives of others.</p>
						</li>
												
						<li>
							<h4>Mathematics</h4>

							<p>I've always gained enjoyment from solving mathematical problems and exploring new topics, among which are Analytical Geometry, Time-series Analysis, Numerical Methods, Probability Theory and Statistics, Game Theory, Abstract Algebra and Topology. To me it is the mother of all sciences, a powerful language and tool.</p>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<h4>Deep Learning</h4>

							<p>I've a huge passion for Artificial Neural Networks applied to computer vision and timeseries modelling. I've studied the work of Geoffrey Hinton and Yann Lecunn (among others) and have applied LSTMs and CNN in production applications. I make sure to keep up to date with the literature and am always learning.</p>
						</li>				

						<!--li>
							<h4>Web Development</h4>
						
							<p>I've had the fortune of working with great designers and developers. I've embarked on projects which require strong front and backend skills. I set a high quality bar and am thorough.</p>
						</li-->
					</ul>

					<h3>Projects</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>
							<h4>Omega Engine</h4>
							<p>A multiparadigm game engine breaking away from the bug-prone approaches commonplace in the games industry. Leveraging pattern matching, term and graph rewriting, program synthesis and scheduling - coupled with axiomatic models of hardware and APIs. More than just a game engine this project establishes a foundation for all scientific computing, machine learning research and creative endeavours of mine going forward.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Multichannel Signed Distance Field Fonts for VR</h4>
							<p>Inspired by the MSDFGEN thesis project I applied differentiable rendering, incorporating mipmapping and anisotropic filtering, to learn compact multi-channel median filtered signed distance field textures for sharper and more efficient GPU text rendering in VR.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>3D IFS fractal renderer</h4>
							<p>Implemented in the Omega Engine using Vulkan compute shaders this applies OIT (order-independent transparency) so that non-commutative alpha blending functions can be utilised. The resulting images can take on many forms but so far the aesthetics of galaxies or smoke effects are easy to achieve with animated attractors.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>C++ serialization tool</h4>
							<p>Serialization code is auto-generated using memory layout information computed by Clang during compilation allowing complex data types and pointer graphs to be serialized in a highly performant manner with minimal impact on code. Simply flag the classes/structs, with no restrictions on polymorphism or virtual inheritance, that you wish to be serializable and then stream them into and out of any storage buffer or stream.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Wolfram Language Evaluator</h4>
							<p>Inspired by the Physics Project and seeking deeper understanding of the construction of a CAS (computer algebra system), implemented in C++ and using LLVM for JIT and compilation. Based on the description of the evaluator from "Power Programming with Mathematica: The Kernel".</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Neural DSP based Piano Synthesizer</h4>
							<p>The culmination of about 4 years of research, after several different approaches. This differentiable DSP synthesiser can replicate physical instruments using neural models inductively biased with additive and subtractive synthesis and a learned convolution reverb. The final model produces CD quality audio using only a small fraction of a single core.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>OmegaOS</h4>
							<p>A homebrew operating system that boots into a lambda calculus interpreter, which itself is written in BLC (binary lambda calculus).</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>SampleRNN_torch</h4>
							<p>An unconditional neural generative model of raw audio implemented in the Torch framework, capable of modelling complex audio at the sample level. I've many future research plans involving conditional variants of this model applied in a variety of settings.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>VisionMachine</h4>
							<p>An LLVM powered, gesture driven, flow-based programming compiler and development environment. This project aims to circumvent the limitations of traditional compilers and programming languages, balancing creativity with optimal machine code generation, and the ability to hot-patch changes live several orders of magnitude faster than other solutions (Edit and Continue, Indefiant’s Recode). Currently in a prototypical phase, future project aims include GPU acceleration via technologies such as KernelGen and Polly. With time this could be a strong competitor against products such as MaxMSP, PureData and LabView by supporting heterogeneous computing architectures transparently.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Near-Eye Lightfield Display</h4>
							<p>Recreating the VR glasses as described in Douglas Lanman's paper, Near-Eye Light Field Displays. This project is a great opportunity to get hands-on experience with microlenses and microdisplays, solid state gyroscope and lightfield rendering. I have implemented rasterisation and path tracing lightfield renderers, using a combination of OpenGL and OpenCL. The next phase is to house the glasses and mount the solid-state motion tracker. Studying the paper was a good learning experience in the optics and mathematics involved.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Bitcoin Payment Processing System</h4>
							<p>With a custom fork of the bitcoin-core client, adding ZeroMQ support, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Node.js and custom frontend JavaScript users can deposit and withdraw funds via QR code - receiving realtime notifications via WebSocket. The IP for this project is held by my company CoinTech Ltd.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<h4>Projector-Depthcam Calibration Software</h4>
							<p>Performs pose estimation between a depth camera and projector, creating an RGBD video feed as seen from the projector-eye-view. This has applications in interactive installations.</p>
